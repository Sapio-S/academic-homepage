    I am Yuqing Xie (谢昱清), a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. 
    Currently, I work in  <a href="https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank">NICS-EFC</a> Lab, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j8JGVvoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Yu Wang</a>.
    From 2018 to 2022, I studied in Xinya College, Tsinghua University. 
    I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology 
    and B.A. in Foreign Languages and Literatures in 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests lie in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and its applications in robotics. More specifically, I am exploring the following topics:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Robotic control</b>: UAV flight control;</li>
      <!-- <li><b>Robotic simulation</b>: OmniDrones, RoboVerse;</li> -->
      <li><b>RL algorithm</b>: reward shaping, curriculum learning;</li>
      <li><b>RL infrastructure</b>: RLinf; </li>
      <li><b>Large model post-training</b>: RL for LLM and VLA.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I contributed to the development of
