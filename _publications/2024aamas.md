abstract: >-
  We propose a Hierarchical Language Agent (HLA) for human-AI coordination that provides strong reasoning ability while keeping real-time execution. Human studies show that HLA outperforms other baseline agents with stronger cooperation abilities, faster responses, and more consistent language communications.
