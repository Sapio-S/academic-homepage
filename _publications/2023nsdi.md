abstract: >-
  We propose Fluxion, a framework to model end-to-end system latency with modularized learning. Fluxion introduces learning assignment, a new abstraction that allows modeling individual sub-components. With a consistent interface, multiple learning assignments can be dynamically composed into an inference graph, to model a complex distributed system on the fly.
#   Fluxion introduces learning assignment, a new abstraction that allows modeling individual sub-components. With a consistent interface, multiple learning assignments can then be dynamically composed into an inference graph, to model a complex distributed system on the fly. Changes in a system sub-component only involve updating the corresponding learning assignment, thus significantly reducing costs.
