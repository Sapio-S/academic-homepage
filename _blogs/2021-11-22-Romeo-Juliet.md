### Romeo & Juliet

##### 说明
整部剧采取倒叙+插叙的手法。scene0是原剧的最后一幕，人们发现了罗朱之死，唤神父前来叙述完整的故事。在实际表演时，scene0一直在台上的一个角落，与其他幕切换主要靠灯光。

##### scene 0

**Prince** Bring forth the parties of suspicion. 

**Friar** I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excused. 

**Prince** Then say at once what thou dost know in this. 

**Friar** I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife. 

**Friar** （转场词）These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. Therefore love moderately: long love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. 

##### scene 1 舞会

**Capulet** You are welcome, gentlemen! A hall, a hall! Give room. And foot it, girls.(音乐)More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up.

Romeo看到Juliet，对视

**Romeo** What lady’s that, which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? 

**Benvolio** I know not.

**Romeo** O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night. 

罗朱跳舞，跳完舞二人在台上小声说话，全场静止

**Tybalt** This, by his voice, should be a Montague. （拔剑）Now, by the stock and honor of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. 

**Capulet** Young Romeo is it? 

**Tybalt** *’* Tis he, that villain Romeo. 

**Capulet** He shall be endured. I say he shall. 

静止结束，罗朱继续说话

**Romeo** If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this; My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. 

**Juliet** Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss. 

**Romeo** Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? 

**Juliet** Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. 

**Romeo** O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do! They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. 

**Juliet** Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake. 

**Romeo** Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged. 

**Juliet** You kiss by th' book.

**Nurse** Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 

**Romeo** Who is her mother?

**Nurse** Marry, bachelor, her mother is the lady of the house.

**Romeo** Is she a Capulet? O dear account! My life is my foe's debt.（被benvolio勾肩搭背扯到一边）

全场暗，juliet走到台前独白，romeo从旁边慢慢走上前，打追光，舞台道具逐渐清空

**Juliet** *’* Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What’s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. Romeo, doff thy name; And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. 

**Romeo** I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized; Henceforth I never will be Romeo. 

**Juliet** If that thy bent of love be honorable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I’ll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world. 

（Romeo伸出手，Juliet接过，二人走向神父的地方，最好仍然是追光）

**Friar** So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

**Romeo** Ah, Juliet, sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter. 

**Juliet** They are but beggars that can count their worth; But my true love is grown to such excess, I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

**Friar** Come, come with me, and we will make short work; For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. 

**Friar** （转场词，可以提前出现，声音渐大）My Lord doth speak of love. What is Love? Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. 

##### scene 2 打架

*[Enter TYBALT and others]* （注意*tybalt*有几个跟班）

**Benvolio** By my head, here come the Capulets. 

**Mercutio** By my heel, I care not. 

**Tybalt** Gentlemen, good-den. A word with one of you. 

**Mercutio** Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow. 

**Tybalt** You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me occasion. 

**Benvolio** （劝架，挡在中间）We talk here in the public haunt of men. Here all eyes gaze on us. 

**Mercutio** Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I. 

*[Enter ROMEO]* 

**Tybalt** Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain. 

**Romeo** Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting. Villain am I none. 

**Tybalt** Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. 

**Mercutio** O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!*[Draws]* Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk? 

**Tybalt** What wouldst thou have with me?

**Mercutio** Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out. 

**Tybalt** I am for you. *[Draws]*

**Romeo** Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. 

（mercutio被刺伤，倒地）

**Mercutio** I am hurt. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both your houses! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. （死）

**Benvolio** Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 

**Romeo** Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain? Mercutio’s soul Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company.

**Tybalt** Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, Shalt with him hence.
 （二人拔剑打架，tybalt倒下）

**Romeo** This shall determine that. 

**Benvolio** Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.

**Romeo** O, I am fortune’s fool! （跑着下台）

##### scene 0

**Friar** I married them; and their stol’n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city. Capulet, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betrothed and would have married her perforce To County Paris. 

##### scene 3 逼婚
Juliet卧室

**Romeo** And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! （跑下台）

**Juliet** O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fortune, For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back. 

**Lady** Ho, daughter! are you up? now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. 

**Juliet** And joy comes well in such a needy time. What are they, beseech your ladyship? 

**Lady** Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor I looked not for. 

**Juliet** Madam, in happy time! What day is that? 

**Lady** Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. 

**Juliet** I pray you tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! 

**Capulet** （上台）How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears? How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? 

**Lady** Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave! 

**Capulet** Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride? 

**Juliet** Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate, But thankful even for hate that is meant love. 

**Capulet** How, how, how, how, chopped-logic? What is this? ‘Proud’ — and ‘I thank you’ — and ‘I thank you not’ — And yet ‘not proud’? Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. 

**Lady** Fie, fie! what, are you mad? 

**Juliet** Good father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word. 

**Capulet**. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! I tell thee what — get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face. Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! Out on her, hilding! 

**Nurse** God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. 

**Capulet** And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue, Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go! 

**Nurse** I speak no treason.

**Capulet** O, God-i-god-en! 

**Nurse** May not one speak? 

**Capulet** Peace, you mumbling fool! Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl, 175 For here we need it not. 

**Lady** You are too harsh. 

**Capulet** God’s bread! it makes me mad.（下台）

**Juliet** O sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay this marriage for a month, a week; Or if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. 

**Lady** Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. （下台）

##### scene 4 赐药

**Juliet** O, past hope, past cure, past help! （走到神父面前）

**Friar** Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County. 

**Juliet** Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,  Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. Be not so long to speak. I long to die If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy. 

**Friar** Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. 



#####  scene 0

**Friar** Then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease.

##### scene 4 continued

**Juliet** Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! 

**Friar** Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. 

**Juliet** Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.125 Farewell, dear father. 

##### scene 0

**Friar** But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stayed by accident, and yesternight Returned my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.

##### scene 5 殉情

Romeo急匆匆上台

**Romeo** How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace! and lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavory guide! Here’s to my love! *[Drinks]*O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. *[Falls]* 

**Juliet** What’s here? A cup, closed in my true love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative. *[Kisses him]* Thy lips are warm! （看到匕首)O happy dagger! *[Snatches Romeo’s dagger]* This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die. 

（神父匆匆上台，看到尸体，暗场）

##### scene 0

**friar** if aught in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, Unto the rigor of severest law. 

**Prince** We still have known thee for a holy man. Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say in this? 

**Balthasar** I brought my master news of Juliet’s death; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threat’ned me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not and left him there. 

**Prince** Give me the letter. （看信）This letter doth make good the friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death; And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. （召唤两家庭的人）Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
 That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished. 

（两大家族所有人上场）

**Capulet** O brother Montague, give me thy hand This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand. 

**Montague** But I can give thee more; For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet. 

**Capulet** As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady lie — Poor sacrifices of our enmity! 

**Prince** A glooming peace this morning with it brings The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; Some shall be pardoned, and some punished; For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
